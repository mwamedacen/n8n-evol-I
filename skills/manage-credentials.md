# manage-credentials

Path examples use bundled defaults. Resolve source and environment locations from [project configuration](../configuration.md); preserve user preferences and existing conventions.

## When

Any time a workflow needs an n8n credential — whether the user wants the agent to mint it from secrets in the selected environment's private `.env` source (Path A) or to use a credential they already created in the n8n UI (Path B).

## Policy (load-bearing)

1. **The agent NEVER collects API keys, OAuth secrets, or any credential material from the user directly in the chat.** The agent MUST instruct the user to write secrets into the selected environment's secret file (`<env-path>/.env`; legacy `<config>/.env.<env>`) following the project's `.env.example`.
2. **The agent NEVER reads `.env*` files itself.** Reading `.env.<env>` is exclusively a subprocess concern: when the agent invokes this helper, the helper loads the env via `helpers/config.py:load_env()` for the duration of the subprocess. The agent's context never sees secret values.
3. **The agent figures out which credentials are needed** by consulting n8n documentation (Context7 or web search) for the specific node `type`s it intends to use — not from a hardcoded per-service playbook in the harness. Once the agent knows the n8n credential `type` (e.g. `microsoftOAuth2Api`, `gmailOAuth2`, `redis`, `openAiApi`) and which secret-env-var names that type expects, fall into one of the two paths below.

## Path A (agent-mediated creation — preferred when secrets are available in `.env.<env>`)

1. Agent appends the required secret env-var names to the project's `.env.example` (as documentation only; values stay empty) and tells the user to copy them into the selected environment's secret file (`<env-path>/.env`; legacy `<config>/.env.<env>`) with real values.
2. Agent runs:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/helpers/manage_credentials.py create \
  --env <env> --key <yaml-key> \
  --type <n8n-credential-type> --name "<display name>" \
  --env-vars KEY1,KEY2,...
```

3. The helper loads the selected secret source via `config.py:load_env()`, builds the credential `data` payload, POSTs to `<base>/api/v1/credentials`, captures the returned `id` + `name`, and writes them into private environment bindings (legacy YAML) under `credentials.<key>: { id, name, type }`.

`--dry-run` previews the body (with values redacted) without POSTing.

## Path B (user-mediated creation in n8n UI — preferred when OAuth flow needs UI interaction)

1. User creates the credential themselves in the n8n UI.
2. Agent runs:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/helpers/manage_credentials.py list-link \
  --env <env> --key <yaml-key> \
  --type <n8n-credential-type> [--from-name "<existing display name>"]
```

3. The helper GETs `<base>/api/v1/credentials`, filters by `type` (and `name` if `--from-name`), prints matches, picks the unique one (or fails if multiple match without `--from-name`), and writes `id`+`name`+`type` into private environment bindings (legacy YAML) under `credentials.<key>`.

## Idempotence

`create` performs a POST and can create another credential on repetition. Inspect the existing binding first; use `list-link` for a verified existing credential. Ambiguous matches stop. `--dry-run` avoids mutation. Configuration changes detected before the write stop the operation rather than applying it to a changed target.
