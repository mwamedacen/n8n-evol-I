# deactivate-single-workflow-in-env

Path examples use bundled defaults. Resolve source and environment locations from [project configuration](../configuration.md); preserve user preferences and existing conventions.

## When

You want to pause a workflow's triggers without removing the workflow.

## How

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/helpers/deactivate.py --env <env> --workflow-key <key>
```

POST `/api/v1/workflows/<id>/deactivate`. Idempotent on the n8n side.
